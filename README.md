# swtcHR

### WORK IN PROGRESS ###

swtcHR is an AutoIt Script built off the ideas of IdleR. Intended for machines where you want to switch between two programs automatically at different hours of the day. For example it automatically launches your miner to mine at 5pm. And at 6am it turns your miner off and launches a different program or miner. Out-of-the box it'll work directly with any miner, the only thing is users will have to change their miner/program(s) names to miner1.exe and miner2.exe with binary releases, but users can easily change this out for any other miner they prefer in the code and itll work as well.

swtcHR is built around simplicity, and usabilty. Similar to our IdleR, swtcHR is intended to have you up and running in no time, because it piggybacks onto your miner(s) and launches them automatically.

swtcHR is completely free and always will be, plus it doesn't take away any of your hashrate (no fees!).

As of right now, we are still testing swtcHR, so we can't guarantee our code to work out of the box.

How to use: Simply place swtcHR.exe in the same folder as your miners and execute it, after 5pm your computer with fire up your miner. Its that simple!

Windows only for now.
